## 🎯 What it does

> **Most job seekers search job boards. OpportunityHunter searches the ecosystems that reveal companies.**

```text
SOURCE  ──▶  COMPANY  ──▶  PEOPLE  ──▶  HIRING SIGNAL  ──▶  OPPORTUNITY
```

You type one request, for example:

> *Find Python/C++ opportunities in Amsterdam for someone interested in AI, trading and crypto.*

The agent then:

| # | Step | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🧠 **Intent** | Extracts city, country, skills and industries (Claude if configured, otherwise rules). Works for any city |
| 2 | 🗺️ **Plan** | Writes 15+ searches: companies, skills, university career fairs, trading firms, VC portfolios, hackathon sponsors, X |
| 3 | 🌐 **Discover** | Queries every source **in parallel**, streaming live status to the dashboard |
| 4 | 🧬 **Deduplicate** | Merges the same company across sources and combines their signals and people |
| 5 | 🔎 **Research** | Visits each company's public homepage to find its careers page, hiring system (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby…) and public inbox |
| 6 | 📊 **Score** | Scores 0–100 in 7 parts, with a written *why* and source links |
| 7 | 📤 **Deliver** | Dashboard, **Google Sheets**, CSV |

### Dashboard tabs
| Tab | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | KPIs, opportunities by source, score distribution, health |
| **Agent Console** | Search box with city, skill and category pickers, plus a live agent trace |
| **Opportunities** | Ranked table with HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW badges |
| **Company Intelligence** | Why we found it, hiring signals, score breakdown, people, links |
| **Source Graph** | Animated source graph with status for every source |
| **Google Sheets** | One-click sync, plus CSV download |

---

## 🎬 Demo

> ▶ **Demo video (≤ 2 min):** _add your YouTube/Loom link here_

| Time | What to show |
|---|---|
| 0:00 | *"I don't search for jobs. I search for the ecosystems that contain opportunities."* |
| 0:15 | Agent Console → type the request → **Hunt** |
| 0:35 | The search plan and source cards stream in (✓ counts and response times, ✕ failures handled) |
| 0:55 | Ranked opportunities with score badges |
| 1:20 | Click a company → Company Intelligence (why, hiring signals, people, source links) |
| 1:40 | **SYNC TO GOOGLE SHEETS** |
| 1:50 | Source Graph → *"It searches the world's ecosystems for opportunities."* |

**LIVE vs DEMO:** the header toggle picks the mode. **LIVE** calls the real connectors. **DEMO** replays a labelled sample dataset (amber `DEMO DATA` banner) so the video works even offline.

## 🚀 Quick start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js ≥ 18** — `node -v`
- **Python 3 + pandas + openpyxl** (only to import Excel lead reports) — `pip install pandas openpyxl`

### 1. Install and build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/opportunityhunter.git
cd opportunityhunter
npm run setup            # installs dashboard dependencies and builds it
```

### 2. Configure (optional; works with zero keys)
```bash
cp .env.example .env     # Windows: copy .env.example .env
```
Fill in any keys you have (see [Environment variables](#-environment-variables)).

### 3. Import your lead spreadsheets (optional)
```bash
npm run import:leads -- "E:\companies career leads\leads sent by freelancer"
# → reads every .xlsx and every sheet, finds the header rows, deduplicates
# → writes data/private/leads.json (git-ignored, never committed)
```

### 4. Run
```bash
npm start                # → http://localhost:8787
```
Open **http://localhost:8787**, pick **LIVE**, type a request and click **Hunt opportunities**.

Hot-reload development: run `npm start` and `npm run dev:web` in two terminals, then open http://localhost:5173.

### 5. Test
```bash
npm test                 # 7 tests, includes a real end-to-end run
OH_OFFLINE=1 npm test    # offline only
```

## 📊 Opportunity scoring

| Component | Max | Based on |
|---|---:|---|
| Technical fit | 25 | Skills matched as whole words |
| Company relevance | 20 | Industry match (Quant ↔ trading, Crypto ↔ web3…) |
| Hiring signal | 20 | Careers page, active vacancy, hiring system detected |
| International | 10 | Remote / visa / relocation wording |
| Recent activity | 10 | Activity in the last 30 / 120 days |
| Unconventional source | 10 | Source weight + bonus for appearing in several sources |
| Contactability | 5 | Careers URL, website, public contact |

🟢 **HIGH ≥ 75** · 🟡 **MEDIUM ≥ 55** · ⚪ LOW. Every result carries a `why[]` list and its source links.

---

## 🛡 Reliability & evaluation

| Test | Checks |
|---|---|
| Intent parser | Works for any city (Singapore) |
| Planner | Produces university, trading, VC, hackathon and X searches |
| Score invariants | Bounded 0–100, explained, parts add up to the total |
| Precision regression | "AI" does not match inside "email" |
| CSV contract | 21 columns; demo rows labelled |
| **Chaos** | Every source forced to fail → no crash |
| **Live end-to-end** | ≥ 3 external apps return data; every result has a source link |

**Design:** all sources run in parallel and one failing doesn't stop the others, with a 35-second timeout each. Claude falls back to rules and Sheets falls back to CSV. Success is shown only after a real write. Chaos test the running app with `OH_FORCE_FAIL=github,openstreetmap npm start`.

**Observed:** during testing, GitHub and the job-board APIs hit rate limits. The agent kept going and still returned 20 Singapore opportunities from the imported lead reports.

## 📗 Google Sheets setup

<div align="center">

![Google Sheets output](screenshots/google-sheets-output.png)

<sub><b>Sample output:</b> the exact rows and columns the Sheets sync writes, from a DEMO run (no private contacts), rendered as a preview with <code>node scripts/sheet_preview.mjs</code>. After a real sync the sheet is styled automatically: dark frozen header, filters, green/amber/red score colour scale, banded rows, wrapped “Why” column and a status dropdown.</sub>

</div>


1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → create a project → **enable the Google Sheets API**.
2. **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create** → Keys → Add key → JSON → save it as `credentials/service-account.json`.
3. Create a Google Sheet → **Share** it with the service account's `client_email` as **Editor**.
4. In `.env`, set `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=` to the ID from the sheet URL (`/d/<ID>/edit`).
5. Restart with `npm start` → run the agent → **SYNC TO GOOGLE SHEETS**.

**Columns:** Company · Country · City · Industry · Opportunity Type · Role · Website · Careers URL · Source · Source URL · Founder · CTO · Recruiter · Public Professional Contact · Opportunity Score · Why This Is Interesting · Technical Fit · Visa / International Hiring · Status · Discovery Date · Notes

**Planned multi-tab workbook:** `Companies` · `Jobs` · `People` · `Application Tracker` (status dropdowns, follow-up dates) · `Dashboard`, with styled headers, frozen rows, filters, colour-coded scores and banded rows.

## ⚙ Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` / `SERPER_API_KEY` | Web search for the ecosystems |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Google Places discovery |
| `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`, `GOOGLE_SHEET_TAB`, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` | Google Sheets |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Higher GitHub rate limits |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Claude intent parsing |
| `OH_FORCE_FAIL` | Chaos testing (comma-separated source ids) |
| `PORT` | Default `8787` |

## 🔒 Privacy & responsible use
- 🚫 No CAPTCHA bypass, no disguising the tool as a human visitor, no logging in to scrape, no hidden-field extraction.
- 🔐 Imported lead data (names, emails, LinkedIn URLs) stays in `data/private/`, which is **git-ignored**. Secrets live in `.env` / `credentials/`.
- 👤 People found on the web are limited to public professional information. LinkedIn is opened in your browser for manual review.
- ✅ Verify contacts before outreach, and follow anti-spam and data-protection law (GDPR / CAN-SPAM).

## ⚠ Limitations
- Without search or Places keys, the university, VC, hackathon, trading and X searches are planned but **not run**. The UI says so.
- Scoring is heuristic, and company-name deduplication can miss aliases.
- Imported lead reports are third-party research and may be stale.
- The demo dataset's signals are illustrative.

## 🗺 Roadmap
- [ ] Multi-tab formatted Google Sheets workbook (Companies / Jobs / People / Application Tracker / Dashboard)
- [ ] Official business-registry connectors (Singapore data.gov.sg, UK Companies House, OpenCorporates) and a directory connector that checks each site's terms
- [ ] Company-name extraction from career-fair PDFs
- [ ] Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby job-list APIs
- [ ] Outreach drafts for review, scheduled hunts, alerts for new HIGH opportunities
